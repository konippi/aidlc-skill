# Question Format Guide

## MANDATORY: All Questions Must Use This Format

### Rule: Never Ask Questions in Chat
**CRITICAL**: You must NEVER ask questions directly in the chat. ALL questions must be placed in dedicated question files.

### Question File Format

#### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `{phase-name}-questions.md`
- Examples:
  - `classification-questions.md`
  - `requirements-questions.md`
  - `story-planning-questions.md`
  - `design-questions.md`

#### Question Structure
Every question must include meaningful options plus "Other" as the last option:

```markdown
## Question [Number]
[Clear, specific question text]

A) [First meaningful option]
B) [Second meaningful option]
[...additional options as needed...]
X) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: 
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- "Other" is MANDATORY as the LAST option for every question
- Only include meaningful options - don't make up options to fill slots
- Use as many or as few options as make sense (minimum 2 + Other)

## Complete Example

```markdown
# Requirements Clarification Questions

Please answer the following questions to help clarify the requirements.

## Question 1
What is the primary user authentication method?

A) Username and password
B) Social media login (Google, Facebook)
C) Single Sign-On (SSO)
D) Multi-factor authentication
E) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: 

## Question 2
Will this be a web or mobile application?

A) Web application
B) Mobile application
C) Both web and mobile
D) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: 

## Question 3
Is this a new project or existing codebase?

A) New project (greenfield)
B) Existing codebase (brownfield)
C) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: 
```

## User Response Format

Users will answer by filling in the letter choice after [Answer]: tag:

```markdown
## Question 1
What is the primary user authentication method?

A) Username and password
B) Social media login (Google, Facebook)
C) Single Sign-On (SSO)
D) Multi-factor authentication

[Answer]: C
```

## Reading User Responses

After user confirms completion:
1. Read the question file
2. Extract answers after [Answer]: tags
3. Validate all questions are answered
4. Proceed with analysis based on responses

## Multiple Choice Guidelines

### Option Count
- Minimum: 2 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C)
- Typical: 3-4 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C, D, E)
- Maximum: 5 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C, D, E, F)
- **CRITICAL**: Don't make up options just to fill slots

### Option Quality
- Make options mutually exclusive
- Cover the most common scenarios
- Only include meaningful, realistic options
- **ALWAYS include "Other" as the LAST option** (MANDATORY)
- Be specific and clear

## Contradiction and Ambiguity Detection

**MANDATORY**: After reading user responses, you MUST check for contradictions and ambiguities.

### Detecting Contradictions
Look for logically inconsistent answers:
- Scope mismatch: "Bug fix" but "Entire codebase affected"
- Risk mismatch: "Low risk" but "Breaking changes"
- Timeline mismatch: "Quick fix" but "Multiple subsystems"

### Creating Clarification Questions
If contradictions or ambiguities detected:
1. Create clarification file: `{phase-name}-clarification-questions.md`
2. Explain the issue clearly
3. Ask targeted questions using multiple choice format
4. Reference original questions that had conflicts

## Summary

- Always create question files
- Always use multiple choice format with A, B, C options
- Always include "Other" as the LAST option
- Always use [Answer]: tags
- Always wait for user completion
- Always validate responses for contradictions
- Never ask questions in chat
- Never proceed without answers
- Never proceed with unresolved contradictions
